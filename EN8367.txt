Chapter 1 The doctor
 I met Dr. Jack Daly in August.
It was a Saturday afternoon. I was at a party in Denver at my friend Judy Kaplan's house. We were in the backyard and it was hot. It's always hot in the summer in Denver. It was a good party. About fifty people were there and there were drinks and good food.
I walked around the backyard and talked to people. I had a drink and tried some food. And then, I met Jack Daly.
"Hi," he said. He had black hair and blue eyes. "My name's Jack. Jack Daly."
"Hi," I said. "I'm Flick. Flick Laine."
We talked a little. He told me he was a doctor and that he worked at the University of Colorado Hospital in Denver
"What about you?" he asked me.
"I'm a detective," I said. "Denver Police Department." 
"Oh, a cop!" he said with a smile. He had very white teeth.
I smiled back at him. "Yeah." I said, "a cop."
 "So where's your police car?" he said.
"That's my car, over there," I said. "It's the red 1957 Chevrolet."
"A 57 Chevy! That's a beautiful car!" he said. "I love old Chevies."
We talked some more about cars. Then, "OK." he said. "now tell me more about you."

"Well." I said, "my first name's.. Felicity." I laughed.
"Felicity?"
"Yes," I said. "My dad liked it. But please call me Flick." 
We talked a little more. After some minutes, he said.
 "Well, I'm leaving now. Flick. Can I see you again some time?" He smiled again. He had a beautiful smile.
I smiled too. "OK, Sure," I said and gave him my phone number. He walked slowly out of the backyard and I watched him. "Tall and dark. Nice!" I thought.
Later, after the party, I talked to Judy about Daly
"Tell me about the doctor." I said.
"Jack Daly?" Judy looked at me. "He's a very good doctor. All the rich people go to him; you know, movie stars, sports stars. He's famous at the hospital." Judy is a doctor too, at the university hospital. 
"Oh, famous, is he?" I said. "I don't often like famous people,"
Judy looked into my eyes. "Oh, come on. Detective Laine," she said, "you like him! I watched you with him. All the women like him."
The next Monday, Jack Daly phoned me.
"I want to talk to you about something," he said. "How about coffee?"
"Sure," I said.
"Friday, eleven o'clock at the Black Cat coffee shop on Broadway?"
"OK." I said. "See you on Friday."
But I never saw Jack Daly again. On Wednesday my boss, Leo Cohn, chief of the Denver Police Department. called me into his office.
"Dead?" I said. "Jack Daly"
"Did you know him!"
"Not very well," I said. "I met him at a party four days ago. 
"Oh." said Cohn, "Well, now he's dead."
 "How?" I asked. "Was it at the hospital?"
Cohn stood by his desk with some papers in his hand. He was a thin man who worked too much. He never sat down.
"No," said Leo. "He died in his office downtown. Reno's there now." Reno was Danny Reno, a detective in the Denver Police Department. "He thinks Daly killed himself."
"Killed himself?"" I felt cold.
"Reno thinks so," said Leo.
 "But Daly phoned me on Monday, Leo," I said. "He wanted to talk to me about something this Friday. A man who wants to kill himself doesn't do that!"
"Well, Reno says he's dead and he has a gun in his hand," he said. "Reno's waiting for you. Go and have a look. The office is at 1237 Sherman,"
I looked at my watch. It was nine o'clock. I took my car key and my gun and got into my red Chevrolet. I drove to Daly's office on Sherman.

Chapter 2 Dead

It was a hot day. It was late August and, at nine o'clock in the morning, it was hot. I drove fast and turned the radio on. I like to listen to music in the car. This time it was Norah Jones, singing Cold Cold Heart. But it was no good. I only thought about Jack Daly, "I want to talk to you about something," he said. I thought about the coffee and the conversation we didn't have.
Fifteen minutes later I was at his office. The first thing I saw was his dead body, lying over his desk. The gun was in his hand.
I didn't speak for a minute. I often see dead bodies. It's my job. But they're not often people I know, I turned away from Daly's body and looked at the room. The office was big and looked expensive; the office of a rich doctor. There were some pictures of American cities on the wall: Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco.
And behind Daly's body, out the window, was Denver. It was twenty past nine in the morning and Denver looked like it always looked. A man was dead, but the city didn't change. That's how it is
Then I turned to Danny Reno. There were two police officers with him.
"I want photos of everything." I said to Reno. "And can you take some fingerprints of the room and the gun?"
The gun?" asked Reno. "Don't you think he killed himself, Detective?"
I looked back at Daly's body. The gun was in his right hand. I thought about Judy's party and Jack Daly with a glass in his hand. His left hand.
"Um," I said, "I think Jack Daly was leff-handed."
Reno just looked at me. He was about twenty-four with very black hair and Italian good looks. He wasn't very tall and he ate too much. But he was a good cop.
"Yes. Detective," he said. "We'll take the fingerprints right now."
"Who found the body?" I asked.
"Mark Johnson," said Reno. "He cleans the office." "Where is he?" I asked.
"He's in the next room. He's waiting for you."
I talked to the cleaning man. Mark Johnson. He was a twenty-year-old student at the University of Colorado. He cleaned offices to make a little money.
Johnson cleaned six offices. That Wednesday morning he opened Dr. Daly's office at about eight-fifteen and found him. Dead. Then he phoned the police.
"What do you know about Dr. Daly?" I asked.
"Not much," he said. "I sometimes saw him and said Good morning. I thought he was a nice guy,"
"Yeah." I thought. "Jack Daly was a nice guy"
 "Can I go now?" asked Johnson.
"Sure," I said, "but are you leaving Denver?"
"No." Johnson answered.
"Good." I said. "Call me if you think of anything  important."
Johnson told Reno where he lived and then he left. I sat and thought. I only met Dr. Jack Daly that one time. And it was a short meeting. But I didn't think that he killed himself.
OK. He didn't kill himself. So, who did kill him?
